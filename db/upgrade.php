/**
 * This file keeps track of upgrades to the advices block.
 *
 * Sometimes, changes between versions involve alterations to database 
 * structures and other major things that may break installations.
 * 
 * The upgrade function in this file will attempt to perform all the necessary
 * actions to upgrade your older installation to current version.
 * 
 * If there's something it cannot do by itself, it will inform you what you 
 * need to do.
 * 
 * The commands here will all be database-neutral, using the functions defined 
 * in lib/ddllib.php
